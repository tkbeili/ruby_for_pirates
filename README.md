# Ruby for Pirates
These are the files for a [CodeCast](https://codecast.io) series that teaches the basics of programming fundamentals in the Ruby language.

The series is available for free here: 

## Technique
This series uses a technique where lessons are not fully planned in advance, each lesson has general topics / guidelines but is left up to the instructor to drive. 

Each lesson's materials is put within the folder for the lesson (which is split into days). Each lesson's folder has the persenattion, homework, notes and code included.

The lessons use a pirate theme, which should make it easier to come up with examples and exercises related to pirates. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

## Using The Series
To make best use of this series. I suggest you do the following:
- Install [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) (library used for presentations), 
- Fork the repo
- Delete all the code and notes content
- Build the notes and code examples as you teach lessons
