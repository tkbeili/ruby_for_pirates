## Question 1: Random
Pirates need to decide on a direction to go to find other ships. Sometimes they feel lucky and they want to just pick a random direction to go. 

Write a line of Ruby code that generates a random number between 0 and 360 (no decimal points) so pirates can decide what degree they should point their ship to.

hint: look into using the `Math` class


## Question 2: Documentation
Find out how to tell if a number is odd or even using a method.

## Question 3: Challenge
What is 0.2 + 0.1? (it's not 0.3)

This may take you in a rabbithole and may require you to dig deeper into how numbers are stored in memory. Do it if you're up for the challenge
