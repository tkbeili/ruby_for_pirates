# Classes and Objects in Ruby
We use the `class` keyword to create classes. Class names must be constants, this means they must start with a capital letter.

The convention is to use `CamelCase` for naming classes. So if you want to name a class street address, you should name the class `StreetAddress`, although `Street_address` and `Streetaddress` are viable names, they don't follow the convention.

We use classes to create object. The technical expression for this is `objects are instances of the class`. We use the words `object` and `instance` interchangably.
