## Question 1: Pirate Speech
Write a piece of code that does the following:

1- Ask the user to enter a sentence
2- Replaces all occorances of certain words in the sentence to their pirate equivalent:
```
Hello -> Ahoy
Hi -> Ahoy
Friend -> Matey
Friends -> Mateys
Yes -> Aye
```

Make sure to replace regardless of the case.

3- Add an `Arrrrr` at the end of the sentence
4- Print the sentence out
5- Stretch: Keep the capitalization the same, for instance if a word is `yes` you should replace it with `aye` and if the word is `Yes` then replace it with `Aye`.

We haven't covered variables yet, so attempt to do it without using variables.
