## Basics of programming with the Ruby language

# Why Ruby?

---

## Ruby is simple and is probably the best starting language

---

> I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be __productive__, and to __enjoy programming__, and to be __happy__. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.

_Ruby creator Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)_

# Ruby is elegant

---

## Beautiful Syntax

```ruby
if temp > 25
  puts 'hot'
else
  puts 'cold'
end
```
vs
```js
if(temp > 25) {
  console.log('hot');
} else {
  console.log('cold');
}
```
