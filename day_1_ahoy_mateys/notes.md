# Day 1

## Setting Up Ruby

For windows use this URL: [https://rubyinstaller.org/](https://rubyinstaller.org/)

On Linux or Mac computers, I highly recommend using RVM: 

[https://rvm.io/rvm/install](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

By running this command in Terminal: 
`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

## Using Terminal

Here is a free tutorial on using Terminal: 
[https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics)

To find out the Ruby version currently running use: `ruby -v`

To list the Ruby versions available with RVM use `rvm list`

To install a new Ruby version with RVM use `rvm install 2.6.3`

## Ahoy Mateys! (A.K.A Hello World)

```ruby
puts 'Ahoy Mateys!'

puts 'Hello World!'
```

## Editor: Visual Studio

Install Visual Studio from here: 
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Running a Ruby file
You can run a Ruby file from a Terminal program by running:
```
ruby ahoy_mateys.rb 
```
in this case `ahoy_mateys.rb` is the file name
