# Conditionals Homework

## Question 1
Pirates love beer! Write a loop that generates the `99 Bottles of Beer` Rhyme, which goes like this:
```
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...
98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...
..
```
And so on until you get to 0 bottles.

Stretch: use a method that property use plural or singular for the word `bottle` so if the number is `1` it should print `1 bottle` otherwise, it should print `x bottles`.

## Question 2
The pirate captain need to know the names of all the pirates on his ship. Write a program that does the following:
1- It asks the user a question `what is your name?`
2- It captures the name
3- After that it keep asking the user `any you?`
4- Then it captures the all names typed by the user
5- The program should stop when the user enters `exit` (case insensitive)
6- The program should print `Ahoy name 1, name2, ...` (put all the names caputred)

Stretch: put an `and` before the last name.
