# Loops in Ruby

For loops keep in mind the following:
- It execute a piece of code a number of times
- There must be a condition by which the loop must stop, for instance, in `while` loops we increment a variable, in for loops, we use ranges which automatically ends the loop at the second number
- Watch for infinite loop, and if you made the mistake, then press `control + c` to stop your program
